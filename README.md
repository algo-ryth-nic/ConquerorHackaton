# DERMA360

## Problem Identified 
The diagnosis and treatment of skin related illnesses such as monkeypox and skin cancer remains a challenge for patients due to the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. These methods are often invasive and costly, making it difficult for patients to access accurate and efficient care. This creates a gap in the healthcare system that needs to be addressed to ensure that patients receive the best possible care for their conditions.

## Solution
Our dermatologist healthcare app provides an easy access to users as a preliminary diagnosis to their skin illness by leveraging AI to provide quick and accurate diagnoses. By using this app, patients can receive a non-invasive, cost-effective, and efficient solution for their skin related illnesses, helping to bridge the gap in the healthcare system and improve patient outcomes.

## Project Description 
Our dermatologist healthcare app is a solution to for providing diagnosises to skin related illnesses at ease in scale. Traditional methods of diagnosis are often invasive and costly, for example, the use of a dermoscope can be quite invasive to patients. This creates a gap in the healthcare system that needs to be addressed. Our app is designed to provide a convenient and cost-effective solution for patients.

The app serves as a user-friendly interface for patients to upload an image of their infected area and receive a quick and accurate  diagnosis. Utilizing AI technology, our app provides a detailed diagnosis of the patient's condition and recommended post care services. The results are displayed on the app and the app also serves as a platform for connecting patients with local dermatologists.

Our prorject is aimed at improving patient outcomes by providing a simple and accessible solution for skin related illnesses. We understand that traditional diagnostic methods can be cumbersome and ineffective, and our app is designed to address this challenge by providing a non-invasive and efficient solution.

With the increasing demand for healthcare solutions that cater to the growing needs of patients, Our app has the potential to disrupt the traditional healthcare model and improve patient outcomes, making it a worthwhile investment as well.

## How it Works ?
The app serves as a simple and user-friendly interface for patients to upload an image of their infected area. Once the image is uploaded, it is sent to a flask server that hosts the AI models, which provide a quick and accurate diagnosis. The results are then displayed on the app for the patient to view and understand. The app also acts as (a concept) platform for connecting patients with local dermatologists.
